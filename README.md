# Smart Shopping System

A sophisticated e-commerce recommendation system using multi-agent AI framework for personalized shopping experiences.

## System Architecture

### Data Collection & Storage
- User Data: Browsing history, purchase patterns, demographics, preferences
- Product Data: Categories, pricing, stock levels, popularity
- Interaction Data: Clicks, add-to-cart events, dwell time, search queries
- Contextual Data: Weather, location, device type, seasonal trends

### Storage Infrastructure
- Long-term: PostgreSQL (distributed)
- Real-time: MongoDB + Redis (caching)
- Data Pipeline: Apache Airflow

### Multi-Agent AI Framework
1. Customer Segmentation Agent
2. Recommendation Engine
3. Real-Time Personalization Agent
4. Inventory & Supply Chain Agent
5. Performance & Testing Agent

### Tech Stack
- Data: PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Redis, Apache Airflow
- AI: Python (scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch), Transformers, Prophet
- Backend: FastAPI, WebSockets, Kubernetes, AWS Lambda
- Frontend: React (web), React Native (mobile)
